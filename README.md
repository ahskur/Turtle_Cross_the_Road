# Turtle_Cross_the_Road
 Day 23 of 100 Days of Code Challenge


This is another capstone project from 100 Days of Code.

Using the Turtle module and creating new classes, I've made the most basic version of Cross the Road.

You can move Up, Left and Right using the keyboad arrows. 

When you get to the top, you go up a level. The cars get faster and faster each subsequent level.
